## Description of the Project

The project is a website, developed in Django, for users to easily buy groceries. Simular to Eldum Rétt or Blue Apron, the service will send ingrediences to a customer periodically on a weekly basis or more often.

## Sprint 1

We desided on building the website up in Django and Postgres. Possibly using Atomic for the UI in the future. We are currently using built in models; admin and users. We have implemented register, login, look at profile, logout and delete user.

## Software Architecture

Our software is designed in well defined layers; Presentation Layer, Logic Layer and Data Layer.

We are using Django to develop both the PL and LL. In the PL we use Django templates, that uses html and css along with a bit of python. In the LL we only use python to build Django views, that deside on templates to show user and we build Django models, this desides what and how data is stored.

The datalayer is stored in SQL using Postgres, we store our models in SQL table format.
